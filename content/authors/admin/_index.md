My name is Chen Jiao, come from SHINE-MING WU SCHOOL OF INTELLIGENT ENGINNEERING. I was born and raised in YunNan, a province in southwest China. My hometown is a beautiful small city, ZhaoTong, It’s the place where my dream begins. As many other young people, we left our hometown to study in big cities when we were teenagers. On the Internet, we are called “people who are with book smart”, which indicates people who are from small towns, they are test-wise candidates, and people who intend to immerse themselves with excessive assignments. 

I’m a good team player, I am good at communicating ideas and getting on with different people. I am highly driven and goal-oriented. I’m also creative and efficient. I work very hard and enjoy solving problems and getting things done before deadlines.
